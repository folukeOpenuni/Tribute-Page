                    <p>Lee Child books features a guy called <a href="http://www.leechild.com/jack-reacher.php">
                    'Jack Reacher'</a>. Reacher was an ex-army major Military Police, a peripatetic loner who leaves
                    no traces except in the hearts of those he has touched. He is a dynamite, scourge of the wicked,
                    righter of wrongs, a one-man wrecking crew, hurling bad guys into the darkness with breath-taking
                    efficiency. And Trouble always seems to find him.

                    <p>I once forget to sleep because I was enjoying the book so much.  I knew it was dark when I 
                    picked the book up, but not by much.  The next thing I know it was brighter than usual, I pulled
                    the curtain to see what was going on when I notice the sunrise.  It was morning and I’ve not slept
                    a wink

                    <p>I’ve read every books written by Lee Child, some more than once.  For some of the books I read

                        <p>Jack Reacher takes an aimless stroll past a pawn shop in a small Midwestern town. In the window
                        he sees a West Point class ring from 2005. It’s tiny. It’s a woman cadet’s graduation present to 
                        herself. Why would she give it up? Reacher’s a West Pointer too, and he knows what she went through
                        to get it.

                        <p>When you're as big and rough as Jack Reacher - and you have a badly set, freshly busted nose - 
                        it isn't easy to hitch a ride. At last, he's picked up by three strangers - two men and a woman.

                        <p>Someone has taken a long-range shot at the French president but failed to kill him. The 
                        suspected sniper has serious skills and is a hard man to find. Reacher tracked him down once and
                        put him in jail. Now he's asked to hunt him again, and put him away permanently.
